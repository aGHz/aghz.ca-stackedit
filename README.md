aGHz.ca-StackEdit
=================

StackEdit is a full-featured, open-source Markdown editor based on PageDown, the Markdown library used by Stack Overflow and the other Stack Exchange sites.

> **This is not the StackEdit that you are looking for!**
>
> This is my personal fork I use to edit [aGHz.ca](http://aghz.ca). You are probably looking for [the real StackEdit](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit).

> **NOTE:**
>
> - Documents are stored in the [browser's local storage][1], which means they are not shared between different browsers/computers. Clearing your browser's data may delete all your local documents.
> - Full access to Dropbox or Google Drive is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit. Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server.
